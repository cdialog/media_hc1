### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains the media for the game H-Craft Championship.
The idea is that you may use it as test-media while working with the H-Craft Championship sources.
See http://www.irrgheist.com/hcraftsource.htm for the sources.
Note that the media is *not* under a free license. You may not redistribute it or create any derivate work.  Check the media_license.txt in the root folder for more details.

### How do I get set up? ###

Put it in a folder besides the H-Craft project folder. This repository folder must be called media_hc1 as that name is used in the build-scripts of H-Craft.
See the H-Craft Championship documentation for the rest.
